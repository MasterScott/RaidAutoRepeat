# RaidAutoRepeat
Auto Clicker for Raid: Shadow Legends

# Requirements
For raw AHK files you will need Autohotkey installed
The exe can simply be executed
\* you will need to click on "more" and execute when a security window shows up
\* this is because Windows 10 needs signed file compilations

# Setup
1. On start double click on the Tray Icon to open settings (or Press F9)
2. Set your desired waiting time between clicks
3. Make sure the Name for the Window is correct
    - for Emulator simply "Nox" or "BlueStacks" is enough (if you don't use an emulator just keep it at default)
    -  for the Plarium Client leave it as it is
4. Save

# Usage
* Press F4 and let it run
* Change the sleep timer in the settings if you want different sleep times

# Hotkeys
F1: Help  
F4: Start stop timer  
F6: resizes active window from 760x480 to 1920x1080 and back; I use sthis for my recordings  
F7: Set max runs (default 0 for unlimited)  
F9: Open settings
